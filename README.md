Overview
--------
The goal of this project was to apply nonlinear control analysis techniques to analyze a relatively new robust bipedal walking control strategy. The 'Foot Placement Estimator' (FPE) attempts to determine where a bipedal robot must place its foot to *regain* balance, as opposed to conventional methods of achieving bipdal locomotion which are based on constantly *maintaining* balance throughout the whole gait cycle (i.e. Zero-Moment Point based control strategies).  

Additional details about the project can be found on this page about my [MASc Research][1].
